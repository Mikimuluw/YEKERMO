# UI Heuristics v1 (Locked)

## A. Structure

- One primary action per screen
- No infinite feeds
- Navigation depth must be shallow and predictable

## B. Layout

- Typography defines hierarchy (titles > content > metadata)
- Whitespace is intentional and preserved
- Symmetry preferred over expressive layouts
- Buttons are visible but restrained

## C. Interaction

- Motion acknowledges state; never celebrates
- Transitions are calm and slightly slower than average
- Disabled actions must include a brief explanation

## D. Copy

- Declarative, not persuasive
- No urgency language
- No promises about future behavior

## E. Psychology (Implicit Only)

- Authority is assumed through consistency
- Curation is implied, never stated
- History replaces gamification

## F. Regression Test

If a change increases urgency, novelty, or persuasion → revert.
