## UI Quality Checklist (required if this PR modifies UI)

**If you changed any screen, layout, theme, or copy, you must satisfy [docs/ui_quality_checklist.md](../docs/ui_quality_checklist.md).**  
Merge policy: [docs/ci_ui_enforcement.md](../docs/ci_ui_enforcement.md). Unchecked items block merge.

- [ ] Visual calm & hierarchy (spacing, no dividers, weight + opacity)
- [ ] Color discipline (#5B0E14 / #F1E194 only as specified; neutrals dominate)
- [ ] Cards & layout (radius token, elevation not borders, spacing tokens)
- [ ] Navigation & behavior (header resting; search exploratory)
- [ ] Copy & tone (no hype, calm and grounded)
- [ ] Final: scrolling feels slow; brand intentional; screen established
